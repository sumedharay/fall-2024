1. The most widely used discrete choice model is:
    - GEV
    - probit
    - logit
    - mixed logit
    
2. List the three properties that the choice set in a discrete choice model must satisfy

3. Describe the most common interpretation that is given to the distribution of Ɛ (epsilon)

4. Assess the validity of the following claim: utility-maximizing behavior can be expressed by a random utility model (RUM), but not all RUMs express utility-maximizing behavior

5. Why do you think it is called a Random Utility Model?
# Reading Quiz 3
